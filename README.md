## Overview

This project aims at generating artificial echocardiogram images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and more specifically, NVIDIA's [SPADE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07291).
Then, using the generated images to try and improve segmentation results.

More information about the project and how to run it can be found in the Jupyter Notebook included in this repository.

## About the dataset

We are using the CAMUS (Cardiac Acquisitions for Multi-structure Ultrasound Segmentation) dataset.
It consists of clinical exams from 500 patients, acquired at the University Hospital of St Etienne (France).

The dataset is available [here](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/camus/databases.html), and there is currently a [challenge](http://camus.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/challenge/#challenges) running on it. It has the following architecture:

```
.
├── train
│   ├── patient0001
│   │   ├── 2CH
│   │   │   ├── gt
│   │   │   ├── gt_ref
│   │   │   ├── im
│   │   │   └── im_ref
│   │   └── 4CH
│   │       └── ...
│   ├── patient0002
│   └── ...
├── test
│   └── ...
└── valid
    └── ...
```

There is a total 500 patients. For each of those patient, there are two planes of acquisition: 2 chambers (`2CH`) and 4 chambers (`4CH`).

For both of those planes, `im` contains the echocardiography picture, and `gt` its corresponding mask. Those are 256x256 pictures, with two channels corresponding to the end-diastolic and end-systolic views. Their shape is `(2, 256, 256)`. 

*Note: if needed, `im_ref` and `gt_ref` contain the raw data.*
